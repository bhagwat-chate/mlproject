Syncing data to S3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `make sync_data_to_s3` will use `aws s3 sync` to recursively sync files in `data/` up to `s3://The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. There are two classes: +1 and -1./data/`.
